          <h2>Sandwich</h2><br>
          <h4>
            A sandwich is a dish typically consisting of meat,
            cheese or vegetables used as a filling between slices of bread,
            or placed atop a slice of bread; or, more generally, any dish 
            in which bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food
            type, and allows it to be a finger food. The sandwich began as a
            portable, convenient food in the Western world, though over time 
            it has become prevalent worldwide.

            <h2>Pasta</h2><br>
            <h4>
                Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat 
                flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, 
                then cooked by boiling or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, 
                although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a 
                gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. 
                Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple 
                food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early 
                as 400 BCE in Italy.

          <h2>Desserts</h2><br>
          <h4>
            Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, 
            such as cake, biscuit, ice cream and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine 
            and liqueur. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create 
            desserts. In some parts of the world there is no tradition of a dessert course 
            to conclude a meal.
